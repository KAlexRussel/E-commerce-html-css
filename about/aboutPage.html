            E-Gucci is an American multinational technology company which
            focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and
            artificial intelligence. It has been referred to as "one of the most
            influential economic and cultural forces in the world",and is one of
            the world's most valuable brands.It is one of the Big Five American
            information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Apple, Meta,
            and Microsoft. E-Gucci was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in
            Bellevue, Washington, on July 5, 1994. Initially an online
            marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product
            categories: a strategy that has earned it the moniker The Everything
            Store.It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services
            (cloud computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems
            (satellite Internet), and Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its
            other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods
            Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4
            billion substantially increased its footprint as a physical
            retailer. E-Gucci has earned a reputation as a disruptor of
            well-established industries through technological innovation and
            mass scale. As of 2021, it is the world's largest online retailer
            and marketplace, smart speaker provider, cloud computing service
            through AWS,live-streaming service through Twitch, and Internet
            company as measured by revenue and market share.In 2021, it
            surpassed Walmart as the world's largest retailer outside of China,
            driven in large part by its paid subscription plan, Amazon Prime,
            which has over 200 million subscribers worldwide.It is the
            second-largest private employer in the United States. E-Gucci also
            distributes a variety of downloadable and streaming content through
            its Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Music, Twitch, and Audible units. It
            publishes books through its publishing arm, Amazon Publishing, film
            and television content through Amazon Studios, and has been the
            owner of film and television studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer since March
            2022. It also produces consumer electronicsâ€”most notably, Kindle
            e-readers, Echo devices, Fire tablets, and Fire TVs.
